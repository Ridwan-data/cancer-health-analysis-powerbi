# cancer-health-analysis-powerbi
A data analytics project exploring cancer patient survival and diagnosis trends using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.
# Cancer Health Analysis (Excel + Power BI)

This project analyzes a dataset of over 890,000 cancer patients to uncover patterns in survival rate, diagnosis stage, treatment types, and other key health metrics.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, deduplication, type correction
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard creation

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🔹 Overall survival rate is just **22%** – consistent across all stages and treatments
- 🔹 **Average BMI** is 30.49 – indicating widespread obesity risk
- 🔹 **445,000+** patients had a family history of cancer
- 🔹 No treatment group significantly improved survival
- 🔹 **Malta, Croatia, Greece** top the list for late-stage diagnosis

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/data` – Cleaned data samples
- `/visuals` – Dashboard screenshots and chart
## 🖥️ Power BI Dashboard

📥 The full interactive Power BI dashboard is available for download:

Download zipped Power BI file:  
[`📁 /[medical report challenge.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20737553/medical.report.challenge.zip)



You can open this in **Power BI Desktop** to explore:
- The full data model  
- DAX calculations  
- All visualizations used in the report  


## 📌 Recommendations
- Promote early detection and screening globally
- Address obesity and lifestyle-related risks
- Encourage genetic counseling for high-risk individuals
- Develop personalized treatment models

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
Data storytelling goes beyond numbers — it's about people. This project helped me practice real-world data cleaning, DAX calculation, and insight generation that can influence public health action.
